Another jab to protect myself? More pokes I get I’ll pop
I'm so glad that smart people are still refusing to wear masks in shops. Thanks to their selflessness it highlights that if we just ignore something it'll go away – don't know why we haven't all tried it.
I really hate being stuck at home thanks to the governments lack of controls on covid in school.

This is what I’ve predicted 👀
Johnson’s levelling up will do as much for the North as Cameron’s Northern Powerhouse did.
Really disappointed by the number of people - may of whom should really know better - wearing their face masks under their chin. Is is any wonder Covid continues to spread?

I think women should be able to join men's sports teams and vice versa. I really don't see any problem with for example having a 5 foot 3 inches slim women versus a 300 pound heavyweight boxer because i feel like women are very much equal to any man. Even much faster and stronger men. If anybody takes offense to my point then they need to reevaluate their lives as their are no man that could do anything better than a lady. 
SUPER COOPER WEARS THE GARIBALDI
